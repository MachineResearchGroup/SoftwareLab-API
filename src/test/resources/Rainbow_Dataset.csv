201,Providing text equivalents for non-text media objects: All non-text media objects such as graphical images or video should be provided with alternative equivalent textual descriptions and/or with equivalent text-based functionality.,US
201,Making navigation self-descriptive: Navigation should be designed to help users understand where they are where they have been and where they can go next. General guidance on achieving self-descriptiveness is given in ISO 9241-110.,US
201,Showing users where they are: Each presentation segment (page or window) should provide the user with a clear and sufficient indication of where he or she is in the navigation structure and of the current segment position with respect to the overall structure.,US
201,Offering alternative access paths: Alternative access paths for navigating to a specific unit of content should be offered to support different navigation strategies.,US
201,Minimizing navigation effort: The number of navigation steps needed to reach a certain piece of content should be minimized as long as different mental models navigation strategies and tasks of the user are taken into account. ,US
201,Splash screens should be avoided unless they provide useful content or feedback about the application state to the user. If a splash screen is used a navigation option to skip it should be offered.,US
201,Avoiding opening unnecessary windows: Additional windows such as new browser windows or pop-up windows should only be opened if this supports the users task. Opening new windows can distract confuse or impede users for a variety of reasons. They can superimpose the primary window hiding relevant information. They could make it cognitively more difficult to understand the navigation structure with negative effects on both usability and accessibility. They also require additional user actions for closing unwanted windows. ,US
201,Vertical scrolling should be minimized. This may be done by placing important information at the top and providing links to information that is further down the page. Horizontal scrolling should be avoided wherever possible.,US
201,Designing for input device independence: User interfaces should be designed to allow activation of controls by a variety of input devices. The ability to choose between different input devices for activating controls such as links fields and buttons is important both for users who prefer a certain input mode mobile users and users with disabilities. In general device independence can be achieved if the functionality is operable via a keyboard. ,US
201,Making user interfaces robust: User interfaces should be designed to be as robust as possible in the face of changing technology. This encompasses being able to present content containing newer technologies by older user agents as well as designing content to be usable with future Technologies.,US
201,Acceptable opening / download times: Application pages should be designed and implemented so that there are acceptable opening times and download times for the expected range of technical contexts of use (e.g. bandwidth between the application and the user). This is particularly important for frequently accessed pages or pages that are important for user navigation and exploration such as the home page.,US
201,Minimizing user errors: Potential user errors as well as the effort needed to recover from errors should be minimized. ,US
201,Providing clear error messages: The content of error messages shown on the pages or special error pages should clearly state the reason why the error occurred and if possible actions the user can take to resolve the error. Users expect error messages to be in the same language as the user interface.,US
201,Using appropriate formats units of measurement or currency: When designing user interfaces for use by diverse groups input and output of information elements such as currency units of measurement temperatures date and time phone numbers address or postal codes should be designed so that they are usable.,US
201,Making text resizable by the user: Text should be able to be resized by the user using functions provided by the user agent or other appropriate means i.e. see ISO 9241-171.,US
201,Text quality: The quality of textual content with respect to spelling and grammar should be sufficient so as not to impede readability.,US

201,Supporting text skimming: Fast skimming of text should be supported by the provision of clear links bulleted lists highlighted keywords logical headings and short phrases and sentences.,US
201,Readability of text: Text presented on the pages should be readable taking into account the expected display characteristics and spatial arrangement. ISO 9241-303 shall be consulted for screen text legibility requirements.,US
201,Distinguishable within-page links: Within-page links should be clearly distinguishable from other links that lead to a different page. EX. Within-page links are shown with dashed rather than solid underlines,US
201,Avoiding link overload: Text pages containing large proportions of links should be formatted so that the presence of links does not impede the readability of the text.,US
201,Using familiar terminology for navigation links: Navigation links - particularly links representing the main navigation structure - should be labelled with terms that are familiar to the user based on his/her general knowledge prior experience in the application domain or experience of using other systems.,US
201,"Using descriptive link labels: The target or purpose of a link should be directly indicated by its label avoiding generic labels such as ""go"" or ""click here"" except where the purpose of the link is clear from its context on the page or the labels have commonly understood semantics in the particular application domain. Using appropriate terminology specific to the users tasks and information needs is important for making the content easy to understand.",US
201,Marking links opening new windows: Links that open new browser windows or pop-up windows should be clearly marked.,US
201,Distinguishing navigation links from controls: Navigation links should be clearly distinguishable from controls activating some action. Typical action types in user interfaces include manipulating application data performing searches communication actions such as opening a new e-mail window or starting a chat function and Hpresentation-related actions such as sorting a list of search results.,US
201,Providing printable document versions: If a document is either too long dispersed over several pages or in a specific layout that is not suitable for online reading a printer-friendly version of the document should be provided that prints the content in a form acceptable to the user (e.g. in the expected layout paper format or orientation).,US
201,"Use of ""white space"": ""White space"" on a page i.e. space filled only with the background color should be used in such a way that it does not impair the visual skimming of the page. While white space is an important means of visually organizing the different content elements on a page if the distance between the blocks of information displayed becomes too large rapid skimming of the page can be impeded.",US
201,Selecting appropriate page lengths The length of a page should be selected so as to support the primary purpose and use of the page. Short pages are generally more appropriate for homepages navigation pages or overview pages that need to be read quickly. Longer pages can be more appropriate when users want to read the content without interruptions or when the page needs to match a paper counterpart.,US
201,Using colour: Colour should be used with care taking into account human capabilities and restrictions in perceiving colour and not as the only means of conveying information. Color should never be the only means of coding. Some users may have difficulties in perceiving certain colors or color combinations (color-blindness).,US
201,Using frames with care: If frames are used care should be taken to avoid possible problems for example those involving the use of the back button bookmarking of pages or scrolling of information. When frames are used it is important to title each frame and to describe its purpose and how frames relate to one another other. ,US
201,Providing alternatives to frame-based presentation: If frames are used an alternative way of presenting relevant information without frames should be provided. Providing alternative text-only pages: When style sheets and/or frames are turned off it should be possible for the user to read and understand the page alternatively the user should be provided with an equivalent alternative text-only page. ,US
201,Consistent page layout: Pages should be designed using consistent layout schemes supporting the user in finding similar information at the same position on different pages. Overall layout schemes apply to all pages and are preferable when all pages have a similar structure. Frequently however different pages have different purposes and types of content. In such cases pages can usually be grouped in different categories using one layout scheme for each category consistently.,US
201,Placing title information consistently: Page titles should be placed in a consistent location on the different pages.,US
201,Linking back to the home page or landmark pages: Each page should contain a link leading to the home page of the application or to a landmark page that is easy to recognize for the user.,US
201,Providing a site map: A separate navigation overview such as a site map should be provided for application showing the structure of the site in an overview form.,US
201,Consistency between navigation components and content: If navigation components (or overviews) are shown in conjunction with associated content consistency between the navigation component and the content shown should be maintained by indicating in the navigation component (e.g. highlighting) the topic currently visible in the content area.,US
201,Placing navigation components consistently: Navigation components should be placed consistently on the pages or in the framesets in the pages of the application.,US
201,Taking account of the users tasks and information needs: When providing different access paths or navigation structures for different user groups the tasks and information needs of these user groups should be taken into consideration.,US
201,Making individualization and adaptation evident: It should be made evident to the user when individualization and/or adaptation are used.,US
201,Making user profiles evident: If predefined user profiles or user-specified profiles are used for individualizing or adapting content the profile currently used should be made evident. If profiles are used it is important to provide users with information about this concept and its implications.,US
201,Allowing users to see and change profiles: If user-specified profiles are used users should be able to see modify and delete that profile on demand.,US

515,"The design of the spacecraft shall be such that a single component/part failure (e.g. resistor, transistor) cannot, as far as practicable, cause the failure of spacecraft functions which are essential for mission success (e.g. power supply, data transmission).",FT
515,The design of the spacecraft shall be such that two independent failures cannot cause a hazardous situation for hazard catagories “ catastrophic” and “ severe”. ,FT
515,"Alternate or redundant paths shall be separated or protected such that an event that causes the loss of one functional path will not cause the loss or degradation of alternate, redundant or serial paths",FT
515,Protected switching configurations employing separate “arm” and “ active” operations shall be implemented whenever an unintended activation can lead to an operational hazard (for hazard catagories “ catastrophic” and “ severe”).,FT
515,"Protection systems shall, to the greatest extent possible, be intrinsically fail safe and shall be capable of being enabled and disabled by command.",FT
515,Cross strapping shall be incorporated in between chains of redundant units so that the maximum overall reliability is achieved.,FT
515,The activation of a redundant unit shall not require a change of configuration or operational status of another unit.,FT
515,It shall be possible by ground command to reverse the switching to a redundant unit provided that such switching capability cannot result in an irreversible undesirable configuration.,FT
515,"Hot redundancy shall be provided for functions which are essential for a continuous, uninterrupted operation needed for mission success.",FT
515,Provisions shall be made as far as practically feasible to prevent malfunction or elimination of redundant units by a common cause.,FT
515,"There shall be a trade-off on a case-by-case basis between centrally organised failure detection/reaction (e.g. monitoring by central processor units) or decentralised detection/reaction (e.g. local current limiters, thermostats).",FT
515,"Status indications, including any change-over to a redundant or back-up operating mode and the exact time of occurrence shall be given in the housekeeping telemetry. This information shall also be stored on-board the spacecraft as necessary for later transmission to the ground.",FT
515,Checkout of all redundant or contingency operational modes or units shall be possible during ground testing of the fully integrated spacecraft,FT
515,"Items which require adjustment, servicing or maintenance before launch shall be accessible without removing any equipment from the spacecraft.",MN
